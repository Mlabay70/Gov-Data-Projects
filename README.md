Contains a series of WIP projects related to data sets I found interesting on Data.gov.

Gov Build is a site that lets a user search for properties owned/leased by the GSA, by area. 

Permit search does something similar for all confirmed residential permits in the US. 

--To view the sites download Trial1 and execute the server.py file. The site is still contained to localhost.
